# Battleship

This repository contains the code for a Battleship game implemented in Javascript. This game is a classic two-player naval combat game where players try to sink each other's ships by guessing their locations.

## Gameplay

The game is played on a grid (10x10). Each player secretly places their ships on their grid. Ships have different lengths (e.g: 5,4,3,2,1). Players take turns guessing the coordinates of their opponent's ships.

A hit is marked on the opponent's grid, and a miss is indicated. The goal is to sink all of your opponent's ships before they sink yours. A ship is sunk when all of its squares have been hit.
